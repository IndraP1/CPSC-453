== Student Info and Assignement Details

Name: Mahindra Prasetyo

The following code was not my own:

- boilerplate.cpp was provided but heavily modified.
- vertex.glsl, and fragment.glsl were provided but heavily modified.
-  All code in middleware directory, and makefile were also provided.

Note that I did not use a logarithmic scale as I preferred the look of what I have now. However, everything spins and moves to scale.

== Instructions

In terminal, run the following commands:

. `make`
. `./boilerplate`
. Press left mouse button and drag to explore scene.
. Use scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the scene.
. Use keys `UP, and `DOWN` to change the speed of the scene. 
. Use key `P` to pause the scene. 
. Use key `R` to reset the scene. 
. Use key `Esc` to close the window.
