The following code was not my own:

- boilerplate.cpp uses code adapted and modified from the tutorial, specifically code for generating spirals.
Additionally, a lot of the code used to render with OpenGL was given at the start of the assignment.
- vertex.glsl and fragment.glsl were provided.

== Instructions

In terminal, run the following commands:

. `make`
. `./OpenGL`
. Use keys `q`, `w`, and `e`, to switch between squares/diamonds, spirals, and triangles respectively.
. Use keys `UP`, and `down` to increase or decrease the number of layers displayed respectively.
. Use key `Esc` to close the window.
